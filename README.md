Activity 4 -- Research Compendium Part 1
Introduction
In this activity, students will learn to reproduce a computational environment using BinderHub.Links to an external site.

Prologue
Learn more about Research Compendium and BinderHub in this Primer.Links to an external site.

Instructions
Your repository should look like this: https://github.com/manika-lamba/activity-4/tree/mainLinks to an external site.

Watch the video provided in Canvas (below). Eventhough the video talks about sharing the Jupyter notebook by Binder. The procedure will be the same for both R Script & Jupyter Notebook.

Step 1: Make a new R script OR Jupyter notebook containing any sample code. You can use your older R scripts or Jupter notebooks from other courses OR you can also use the file that you made for AE#3 this week! [1 Point]

Step 2:  Create all the essential files needed for BinderHub to run. See #2 & #3 hereLinks to an external site.. [5 Point]

For R script you need:

install.RLinks to an external site.
Links to an external site.runtime.txtLinks to an external site.
Links to an external site..github/worlflowsLinks to an external site. folder
LICENSELinks to an external site.
Links to an external site.README.mdLinks to an external site.
Links to an external site.your R ScriptLinks to an external site.
For Jupyter Notebook you need:

requirements.txtLinks to an external site.
your notebook.ipynbLinks to an external site. file
LICENSELinks to an external site.
README.mdLinks to an external site.
.github/worlflowsLinks to an external site. folder
Your README.md should be complete and thorough such as https://github.com/textmining-infopros/chapter6/blob/master/README.md

Step 3: Create the BinderHub link. [3 Point]

To make the R Binder link for your repository, copy this line and add your username & repo name: [![Binder](http://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](http://mybinder.org/v2/gh/your_username/your_reponame/main?urlpath=rstudio)

To make the Jupyter Binder link for your repository copy this line and add your username & repo name: [![Binder](http://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](http://mybinder.org/v2/gh/your_username/your_reponame/main?filepath=filename.ipynb)
